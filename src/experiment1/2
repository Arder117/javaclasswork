Currently, primary and middle school students are generally suffering from a decline in their appreciation of national culture and art. In order to inherit the excellent national culture, the Ministry of Education has revised the music curriculum standards for the nine-year compulsory education stage, adding teaching content with Peking Opera, and conducting a pilot program in 20 primary and middle schools in 10 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. After offering Peking Opera courses, teachers should not only be satisfied with the teaching of singing skills, but also take the stories behind the repertoire and how to understand this traditional art form as the main goals of teaching. Bringing Peking Opera into the classroom is to let students know some basic knowledge about Peking Opera, and help them learn to appreciate the beauty of rhythm and the unique charm of Peking Opera.
